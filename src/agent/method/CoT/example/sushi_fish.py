Reasoning:

**Task Analysis:**
We need to prepare a fish sushi that requires chopped fish and cooked rice, then combine the chopped fish, cooked rice, and a piece of nori on a plate. Analyzing the map layout, this is an 8x6 kitchen with fish dispenser, shrimp dispenser, rice dispenser, nori dispenser, and two chopping boards on the top row (y=0), and sink, table with plate, serving window, stove with pot, and other equipment on the bottom row (y=5).

**Initial Agent Positions:**
- agent1 is at (1,4), very close to the fish dispenser
- agent2 is at (6,4), closer to the rice and nori dispensers

**Task Allocation Strategy:**
Considering the complexity of sushi preparation, I decided to assign agent1 to handle fish processing (obtaining and chopping), while agent2 handles rice cooking and nori preparation, as well as final sushi assembly and serving. This division enables parallel processing, with agent2 taking on more time management responsibilities since rice cooking requires a longer duration (16 time units).

**Detailed Execution Plan:**

**Agent1's Task Path (Fish Processing):**
1. Move from (1,4) to (1,1) to approach fish dispenser, distance 3, takes 3 time units, current time 3
2. Interact with dispenser to get fish, interaction takes 0 time, current time 3
3. Move to (5,1) to approach chopping board 1, distance 4, takes 4 time units, current time 7
4. Place fish on chopping board 1, interaction takes 0 time, current time 7
5. Process fish on chopping board 1, takes 4 time units, current time 11
6. Pick up chopped fish, interaction takes 0 time, current time 11
7. Move to (3,4) to approach table with plate, distance 4, takes 4 time units, current time 15
8. Place chopped fish into the plate on table, interaction takes 0 time, current time 15

**Agent2's Task Path (Rice Cooking, Nori Preparation, and Final Assembly):**
1. Move from (6,4) to (3,1) to approach rice dispenser, distance 7, takes 7 time units, current time 7
2. Interact with dispenser to get rice, interaction takes 0 time, current time 7
3. Move to (5,4) to approach stove, distance 6, takes 6 time units, current time 13
4. Place rice into pot on stove to start cooking, interaction takes 0 time, current time 13 (pot cooking takes 16 time units, expected completion at time 29)
5. Move to (4,1) to approach nori dispenser, distance 1, takes 1 time unit, current time 14
6. Get nori, interaction takes 0 time, current time 14
7. Move to (3,4) to approach table with plate, distance 4, takes 4 time units, current time 18
8. Place nori into the plate (which already contains fish), interaction takes 0 time, current time 18
9. Pick up the plate containing nori and fish, interaction takes 0 time, current time 18
10. Move to (5,4) to approach stove, distance 3, takes 3 time units, current time 21
11. Wait 8 time units until rice is cooked, current time 29
12. Take cooked rice from pot and place into plate, interaction takes 0 time, current time 29
13. Move to (4,4) to approach serving window, distance 1, takes 1 time unit, current time 30
14. Submit completed sushi at serving window, interaction takes 0 time, current time 30

**Time Synchronization and Coordination:**
- Agent1 completes fish chopping relatively quickly (time 11), while agent2 needs to handle the more time-consuming rice cooking process
- Agent2 utilizes the rice cooking waiting time to obtain nori after starting the cooking process (time 13)
- Both agents converge at the table around time 18 to combine fish and nori
- Agent2 handles the final assembly task, completing all ingredient combinations at the exact moment when rice is cooked (time 29)

**Optimization Considerations:**
- Reasonable task division allows both agents to work in parallel, avoiding conflicts at critical equipment
- Makes full use of rice cooking waiting time for other necessary operations (obtaining nori, partial ingredient assembly)
- Total completion time is 30 time units, which is an efficient solution considering the 16 time unit constraint for pot cooking
